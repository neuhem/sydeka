# Coordinate Geometry - Straight Lines

## Introduction

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry, combines algebra and geometry to study geometric shapes using coordinates and equations. This lesson focuses on straight lines and their properties.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Find the equation of a straight line in various forms
- Calculate gradients and intercepts
- Identify parallel and perpendicular lines
- Use the distance and midpoint formulas
- Solve problems involving intersection of lines

## 1. The Equation of a Straight Line

### Different Forms

**1. Gradient-Intercept Form:** y = mx + c
- m = gradient (slope)
- c = y-intercept

**2. Point-Slope Form:** y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
- Passes through point (x₁, y₁) with gradient m

**3. Two-Point Form:** (y - y₁)/(y₂ - y₁) = (x - x₁)/(x₂ - x₁)
- Passes through points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂)

**4. General Form:** ax + by + c = 0
- Standard form where a, b, c are constants

### Finding the Gradient

The gradient (slope) of a line through points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:

**m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)**

**Example 1:** Find the gradient of the line through (2, 3) and (5, 9)
```
m = (9 - 3)/(5 - 2) = 6/3 = 2
```

## 2. Intercepts

### Y-Intercept
The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis (when x = 0).

### X-Intercept
The x-intercept is where the line crosses the x-axis (when y = 0).

**Example 2:** Find the intercepts of y = 2x - 6
- Y-intercept: Set x = 0, so y = 2(0) - 6 = -6. Point: (0, -6)
- X-intercept: Set y = 0, so 0 = 2x - 6, x = 3. Point: (3, 0)

## 3. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

### Parallel Lines
- Have the same gradient
- Never intersect
- If line 1 has gradient m₁ and line 2 has gradient m₂, then they are parallel if m₁ = m₂

### Perpendicular Lines
- Their gradients multiply to give -1
- If line 1 has gradient m₁ and line 2 has gradient m₂, then they are perpendicular if m₁ × m₂ = -1

**Example 3:** Are the lines y = 3x + 2 and y = -⅓x + 5 perpendicular?
```
m₁ = 3, m₂ = -⅓
m₁ × m₂ = 3 × (-⅓) = -1
Yes, they are perpendicular.
```

## 4. Distance and Midpoint Formulas

### Distance Formula
The distance between points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:

**d = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]**

### Midpoint Formula
The midpoint of the line segment joining (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:

**Midpoint = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)**

**Example 4:** Find the distance and midpoint between (1, 2) and (4, 6)
```
Distance = √[(4-1)² + (6-2)²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5
Midpoint = ((1+4)/2, (2+6)/2) = (2.5, 4)
```

## 5. Finding Equations of Lines

### Given a Point and Gradient

**Example 5:** Find the equation of the line through (3, -2) with gradient 4
```
Using y - y₁ = m(x - x₁):
y - (-2) = 4(x - 3)
y + 2 = 4x - 12
y = 4x - 14
```

### Given Two Points

**Example 6:** Find the equation of the line through (1, 3) and (4, 12)
```
First find the gradient: m = (12-3)/(4-1) = 9/3 = 3
Using point-slope form with point (1, 3):
y - 3 = 3(x - 1)
y - 3 = 3x - 3
y = 3x
```

### Parallel to a Given Line

**Example 7:** Find the equation of the line through (2, 5) parallel to y = 2x + 3
```
Parallel lines have the same gradient, so m = 2
y - 5 = 2(x - 2)
y - 5 = 2x - 4
y = 2x + 1
```

### Perpendicular to a Given Line

**Example 8:** Find the equation of the line through (1, 4) perpendicular to y = 3x - 2
```
The gradient of the given line is 3
The gradient of the perpendicular line is -1/3
y - 4 = -1/3(x - 1)
y - 4 = -1/3x + 1/3
y = -1/3x + 1/3 + 4
y = -1/3x + 13/3
```

## 6. Intersection of Lines

To find where two lines intersect, solve their equations simultaneously.

**Example 9:** Find the intersection of y = 2x + 1 and y = -x + 7
```
At intersection: 2x + 1 = -x + 7
3x = 6
x = 2
y = 2(2) + 1 = 5
Intersection point: (2, 5)
```

## 7. Applications

### Real-World Problems

**Example 10:** A mobile phone plan costs £20 per month plus £0.10 per minute of calls. Write an equation for the total monthly cost and find the cost for 150 minutes of calls.

Solution:
```
Let C = total cost, m = minutes of calls
C = 20 + 0.10m
For 150 minutes: C = 20 + 0.10(150) = 20 + 15 = £35
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Gradient** measures the steepness of a line
2. **Parallel lines** have equal gradients
3. **Perpendicular lines** have gradients that multiply to -1
4. **Distance formula** comes from Pythagoras' theorem
5. **Always check** your equations by substituting points
6. **Be careful with negative signs** when working with gradients

## Practice Problems

1. Find the equation of the line through (2, -3) with gradient 5
2. Find the gradient of the line through (-1, 4) and (3, -2)
3. Are the lines y = 2x + 3 and 2y = 4x - 6 parallel?
4. Find the equation of the line through (1, 2) perpendicular to y = -2x + 5
5. Find the intersection of y = 3x - 1 and y = -2x + 9

## Summary

Straight lines are fundamental in coordinate geometry. Understanding their equations, properties, and relationships is essential for more advanced topics in mathematics and applications in physics, engineering, and economics.
