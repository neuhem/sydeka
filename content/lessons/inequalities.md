# Inequalities

## Introduction

Inequalities are mathematical expressions that show the relationship between two expressions that are not equal. They use symbols like <, >, ≤, and ≥ to indicate which expression is larger or smaller.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Solve linear inequalities in one variable
- Solve quadratic inequalities using graphical methods
- Work with compound inequalities
- Solve modulus inequalities
- Apply inequalities to real-world problems

## 1. Linear Inequalities

### Basic Rules

When solving inequalities, we follow similar rules to equations, with one important exception:

**When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, flip the inequality sign.**

#### Examples:

**Example 1:** Solve 3x + 5 > 11
```
3x + 5 > 11
3x > 11 - 5
3x > 6
x > 2
```

**Example 2:** Solve -2x + 3 ≤ 7
```
-2x + 3 ≤ 7
-2x ≤ 7 - 3
-2x ≤ 4
x ≥ -2    (inequality flips when dividing by -2)
```

### Compound Inequalities

These involve two inequalities combined with "and" or "or".

**Example 3:** Solve -1 < 2x + 3 < 7
```
-1 < 2x + 3 < 7
-1 - 3 < 2x < 7 - 3
-4 < 2x < 4
-2 < x < 2
```

## 2. Quadratic Inequalities

For quadratic inequalities, we use graphical methods or factoring.

### Method 1: Graphical Approach

**Example 4:** Solve x² - 5x + 6 > 0

1. Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) > 0
2. Find roots: x = 2 and x = 3
3. Sketch the parabola y = x² - 5x + 6
4. Since the coefficient of x² is positive, the parabola opens upward
5. The inequality is satisfied when y > 0
6. Solution: x < 2 or x > 3

### Method 2: Sign Table

**Example 5:** Solve x² - 4x - 5 ≤ 0

1. Factor: (x - 5)(x + 1) ≤ 0
2. Find critical points: x = -1 and x = 5
3. Create sign table:

| Interval | x + 1 | x - 5 | (x+1)(x-5) |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| x < -1   |   -   |   -   |     +      |
| -1 < x < 5|   +   |   -   |     -      |
| x > 5    |   +   |   +   |     +      |

4. We want (x+1)(x-5) ≤ 0, so x ∈ [-1, 5]

## 3. Modulus Inequalities

The modulus (absolute value) function requires special consideration.

### Basic Properties
- |x| ≥ 0 for all real x
- |x| = √(x²)
- |x| < a means -a < x < a (for a > 0)
- |x| > a means x < -a or x > a (for a > 0)

**Example 6:** Solve |2x - 3| < 5
```
|2x - 3| < 5
-5 < 2x - 3 < 5
-5 + 3 < 2x < 5 + 3
-2 < 2x < 8
-1 < x < 4
```

**Example 7:** Solve |x + 2| ≥ 3
```
|x + 2| ≥ 3
This means: x + 2 ≥ 3 or x + 2 ≤ -3
So: x ≥ 1 or x ≤ -5
```

## 4. Graphical Representation

### Number Line Representation

- Open circles (○) for strict inequalities (< or >)
- Closed circles (●) for inclusive inequalities (≤ or ≥)
- Shade the region where the inequality is satisfied

### Coordinate Plane

For two-variable inequalities like y > 2x + 1:
1. Draw the boundary line y = 2x + 1
2. Use a dashed line for strict inequalities
3. Use a solid line for inclusive inequalities
4. Shade the appropriate region

## 5. Applications

### Real-World Problems

**Example 8:** A company's profit P (in thousands) is given by P = -2x² + 12x - 10, where x is the number of units produced (in hundreds). For what production levels is the profit positive?

Solution:
```
-2x² + 12x - 10 > 0
-2(x² - 6x + 5) > 0
-2(x - 1)(x - 5) > 0
(x - 1)(x - 5) < 0
```

Using a sign table or graph: 1 < x < 5

Therefore, the company makes a profit when producing between 100 and 500 units.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Flip the inequality sign** when multiplying or dividing by a negative number
2. **Quadratic inequalities** are best solved using graphical methods or sign tables
3. **Modulus inequalities** require considering both positive and negative cases
4. **Always check your answer** by substituting test values
5. **Use proper notation** for solution sets (intervals, unions, etc.)

## Practice Problems

1. Solve: 4x - 7 ≤ 2x + 3
2. Solve: x² - 6x + 8 > 0
3. Solve: |3x - 2| ≥ 7
4. Solve: -1 ≤ 3x + 2 < 8
5. For what values of x is the expression (x-1)/(x+2) positive?

## Summary

Inequalities are essential tools in mathematics with wide applications in optimization, economics, and science. Master the fundamental techniques of solving linear, quadratic, and modulus inequalities, and always remember to check your solutions graphically or with test values.
