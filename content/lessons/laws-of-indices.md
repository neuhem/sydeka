# Laws of Indices

## Introduction

Indices (also called exponents or powers) are a fundamental concept in mathematics. The laws of indices help us manipulate and simplify expressions involving powers efficiently.

## Key Rules

### 1. Product Rule
When multiplying powers with the same base, add the indices:
$$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$$

### 2. Quotient Rule  
When dividing powers with the same base, subtract the indices:
$$a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$$

### 3. Power Rule
When raising a power to another power, multiply the indices:
$$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$$

### 4. Zero Index
Any number (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals 1:
$$a^0 = 1 \text{ (where } a \neq 0\text{)}$$

### 5. Negative Index
A negative index represents the reciprocal:
$$a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$$

### 6. Fractional Index
A fractional index represents a root:
$$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$$

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Product Rule
**Simplify:** $2^3 \times 2^4$

**Solution:**
Using the product rule: $2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7 = 128$

### Example 2: Power Rule
**Simplify:** $(3^2)^4$

**Solution:**
Using the power rule: $(3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \times 4} = 3^8 = 6561$

### Example 3: Quotient Rule
**Simplify:** $\frac{5^6}{5^2}$

**Solution:**
Using the quotient rule: $\frac{5^6}{5^2} = 5^{6-2} = 5^4 = 625$

### Example 4: Fractional Index
**Evaluate:** $16^{\frac{3}{4}}$

**Solution:**
$16^{\frac{3}{4}} = (16^{\frac{1}{4}})^3 = (\sqrt[4]{16})^3 = 2^3 = 8$

Alternatively: $16^{\frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{16^3} = \sqrt[4]{4096} = 8$

### Example 5: Negative Index
**Simplify:** $3^{-2}$

**Solution:**
$3^{-2} = \frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}$

### Example 6: Combined Rules
**Simplify:** $\frac{x^5 \times x^3}{x^2}$ where $x \neq 0$

**Solution:**
First apply the product rule in the numerator:
$x^5 \times x^3 = x^{5+3} = x^8$

Then apply the quotient rule:
$\frac{x^8}{x^2} = x^{8-2} = x^6$

## Practice Problems

### Problem Set A (Foundation)
1. Simplify: $3^5 \times 3^{-2}$
2. Evaluate: $64^{\frac{2}{3}}$
3. Simplify: $\frac{x^8}{x^3}$ where $x \neq 0$
4. Evaluate: $5^0$
5. Simplify: $(2^3)^2$

### Problem Set B (Intermediate)
6. Simplify: $\frac{2^7 \times 2^{-3}}{2^2}$
7. Evaluate: $27^{\frac{2}{3}}$
8. Simplify: $x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times x^{\frac{3}{4}}$
9. Evaluate: $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{-2}$
10. Simplify: $\frac{(a^2)^3 \times a^{-1}}{a^4}$

### Problem Set C (Advanced)
11. Simplify: $\frac{x^{\frac{2}{3}} \times x^{-\frac{1}{6}}}{x^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
12. Solve for $x$: $2^x = 8^{x-1}$
13. Simplify: $(8^{\frac{1}{3}})^2 \times 2^{-1}$
14. Express in simplest form: $\frac{3^{2n+1} \times 3^{n-2}}{3^{2n-1}}$

## Key Tips for Success

1. **Always check your base**: The laws only apply when the bases are the same
2. **Work step by step**: Don't try to apply multiple rules at once
3. **Convert roots to fractional indices**: This often makes calculations easier
4. **Remember the order of operations**: Handle brackets first, then indices
5. **Practice regularly**: Index laws form the foundation for many advanced topics

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Mistake**: $x^2 + x^3 = x^5$ ❌
- **Correct**: $x^2 \times x^3 = x^5$ ✅

- **Mistake**: $(xy)^2 = x^2y$ ❌  
- **Correct**: $(xy)^2 = x^2y^2$ ✅

- **Mistake**: $x^{-2} = -x^2$ ❌
- **Correct**: $x^{-2} = \frac{1}{x^2}$ ✅

## Applications

Laws of indices are essential for:
- Simplifying algebraic expressions
- Solving exponential equations  
- Working with scientific notation
