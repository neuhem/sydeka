# Introduction to Quadratic Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify quadratic functions and their key features
- Understand the standard form of a quadratic function
- Recognize the shape and properties of parabolas
- Find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts

## What is a Quadratic Function?

A quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree 2. The general form is:

$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

Where:
- $a \neq 0$ (if $a = 0$, it would be linear, not quadratic)
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants
- $x$ is the variable

## Key Features of Quadratic Functions

### 1. Parabola Shape
- All quadratic functions graph as parabolas
- If $a > 0$, the parabola opens upward (U-shape)
- If $a < 0$, the parabola opens downward (âˆ©-shape)

### 2. Vertex
The vertex is the turning point of the parabola:
- For upward parabolas: minimum point
- For downward parabolas: maximum point

The vertex formula: $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$

### 3. Axis of Symmetry
The vertical line that passes through the vertex: $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$

### 4. Y-intercept
When $x = 0$: $f(0) = c$

### 5. X-intercepts (Roots)
Found by solving $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

## Example

Let's analyze $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$:

- $a = 1 > 0$, so parabola opens upward
- Vertex: $x = -\frac{(-4)}{2(1)} = 2$
- $f(2) = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1$, so vertex is $(2, -1)$
- Y-intercept: $f(0) = 3$
- X-intercepts: $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$, so $(x-1)(x-3) = 0$, giving $x = 1$ and $x = 3$

## Practice Problems

1. For $f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6$, find:
   - The vertex
   - The axis of symmetry
   - The y-intercept
   - The x-intercepts

2. Determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward:
   - $g(x) = -3x^2 + 2x - 1$
   - $h(x) = 0.5x^2 - 4x + 8$

## Summary

- Quadratic functions have the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
- They graph as parabolas
- Key features include vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts
- The sign of $a$ determines the direction the parabola opens
